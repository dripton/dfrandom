This program is intended to comply with Steve Jackson Games' online policy,
which is incompatible with Open Source licenses (because they allow selling
while the SJ Games Online Policy only allows giving away for free.) So I have
to use a custom license.  It's based on the MIT license, but slightly modified
to disallow selling the program:
